                            <p>
                                GoPlayMM was created out of a frustration from playing Valve's CS:GO Competitive Matchmaking. Whether it was due too abysmal server performance, an abundance of blatant hackers, or just one of the multitude of other problems plaguing their system, matches where generally more frustrating then fun, and would leave us with a bitter taste for playing competitive. At the same time, competitive offered a brilliant counterpart to community servers, providing what <i>should</i> be a reliable, competitive, consistent, and fun interface to playing the game. GoPlayMM was created to solve the major downsides of Valve's matchmaking, and even enhance on the original ideas set forth by Valve.

                            <h3>No Bullshit Motto</h3>
                            <p>
                                As a team, GoPlayMM believes in a no-bullshit style of management. This means that whenever it's plausible (e.g. legal), we'll prefer transparency over secrecy. Please always feel free to either email us as private means of communication, or address issues publically (within reasonable means, e.g. keeping other's privacy in mind) in our forums.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Cheating/Boosting</h3>
                            <p>
                                GoPlayMM takes a simple and concise approach to handling cheaters. The first step of cheat detection lies in our severs, which run custom plugins built off <a href="http://www.sourcemod.net/">SourceMod</a>, which quickly and correctly detect obvious hacks such as aimbots, triggerbots, no-recoil hacks, and more. Are system can within 5 minutes, detect these hacks with 99% accuracy, allowing for quick and painless bans. As recently found by a user on the CS:GO subreddit, Valve's OverWatch system can take up to 150 matches to ban players that are blatantly aimbotting. Our system promises the same result in under one match (e.g. hackers using blatant hacks get banned during their first match).

                                Although GoPlayMM has a ranking system, we've made significant considerations to avoid boosting. Our ranking algorithms are entirely based on individual skill, which prevents users from lobbying or playing with hackers to boost their rank. This, along with our aimbot detection, virtually prevents boosting within our system.

                                Along with our automatic system, we have an extensive report system that allows players to report other players for cheating, griefing, exploiting or other issues. These reports are guaranteed to be handled by humans, and involve demo review, log review, and more.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Griefing/Behavior</h3>
                            <p>
                                This is the internet, and people are assholes. GoPlayMM does not have any strict rules on behavior, other than the basic "Don't be a dick" (Wheaton's Law). Even so, there will be situations in which players are being abnormally abusive in competitive matches. These will result in staggering temporary bans that can eventually result in permanent bans. The duration and extent of these bans is left entirely up to our internal and community staff of moderators/admins. Even so, we guarantee unless your tripping into illegal territory, we'll always at least give you a warning about your behavior.

                                Along with our system for handling the extremes, we also provide a toolset for players who want to moderate who they play with through a system of blocks. Any player can block another player, which <b>entirely</b> prevents them from getting matched. Although this can lead to longer lobby times, it may be worth it for some players who feel they are being harassed or mistreated by other players in ways that don't fall under our (GoPlayMM's) jurisdiction.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Skill/Rank Imbalance</h3>
                            <p>
                                In Valve's matchmaking, skill and rank imbalance are major issues. GoPlayMM attempts to solve these issues by forcing strict rank balances. Currently, when you queue for a match, our system requires your compiled (your lobby + other lobbies to create teams of 5) team's rank to be within 5 "skill points" of the opposing team. This means that even if you have the best of players, and worst of players, your likely to get matched with a team of players that are either slightly better/worse than your team. This system will still cause problems for players that want to strictly play players who are of equal rank of them. As such, if you are in a lobby of players who are equal or almost equal rank of you, we'll give you the option to enforce strict skill matching, which will <b>only</b> place you with players that are within 5 "skill points" of your rank. We hope that between these two accommodations, you'll be able to both find matches with friends that you have a skill imbalance with, and find matches against players of your skill level.

                            <h3>Competitive Config/Rule Set</h3>
                            <p>
                                GoPlayMM uses a full set of competitive configs and rules to help both enhance the average players experience, and help with league players trying to get in practice. These rules include a 35 second bomb timer, 1:45 round time, no reduction in damage for friendly fire, only 1000$ taken away for teamkills, and more! We're always happy to take suggestions for new rules or cvars in our forums!
